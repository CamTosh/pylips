# Philips Tv Ambilight remote based on Pylips

> This tool was based on [@eslavnov](https://github.com/eslavnov)'s CLI [tool](https://github.com/eslavnov/pylips).

## Idea 

I wanted to be able to launch my favorite applications with an ambilight profile and adapted settings in one click.

## Web Interface

Developed for phone use.

Feel free to fork and contribute to project.
